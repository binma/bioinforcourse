Comparative Functional Analysis Workshop
=======================================================
In this workshop we will do a comparative analysis of several Baltic Sea
samples on function. The following topics will be discussed:

- Find genes on a coassembly of all samples using Prodigal
- Classify the found genes with similar function in Clusters of Orthologous
  Groups (COG) using WebMGA
- Compare the expression of the different COG families and classes by looking
  at their coverage in different samples using R

The workshop has the following exercises:

1. Gene Finding Exercise
2. COG Exercise
3. Comprative Functional Analysis Exercise
