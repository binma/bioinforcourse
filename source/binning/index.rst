Metagenomic Binning Workshop
=================================================
In this metagenomics workshop we will learn how to:

- Perform unsupervised binning with concoct 
- Evaluate binning performance

The workshop has the following exercises:

1. Setup Environment
2. Running Concoct
3. Evaluate Clustering Using Single Copy Genes
4. Phylogenetic Classification using Phylosift

At least a basic knowledge of how to work with the command line is required
otherwise it will be very difficult to follow some of the examples. Have
fun!
